Luck runs out
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted (rugged?), cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel it burn
Still life
Incarnation
Still life
Infamy
Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run
What's to come?
What's to be?
'Cause we'll hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel our shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs...
And you crawl out again
But your luck runs out
